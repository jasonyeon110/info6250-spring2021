# The .gitignore file lists rules for files and directories that git will "ignore"
# (that is, git will not report these files in `git status` and 
# will not add them to the files to commit when you `git add` directories or wildcards

# You can read the rules for the lines below at https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

# For the INFO6250 class, you should not edit _this_ instance of this file
# But you should edit copies in your work under the /work directory
# .gitignore files in subdirectories are added to .gitignore rules from files closer to the root
# but only apply to files in or within their subdirectory
#
# Example: This .gitignore file stops a file called ".DS_Store" (made by the Finder on Macs)
# If you had a .gitignore file in /work that listed "other_file.txt"
# then /other_file.txt would NOT be ignored, but /work/other_file.txt and /work/subdir/other_file.txt WOULD be ignored
